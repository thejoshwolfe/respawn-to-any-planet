# respawn-to-any-planet

A mod for Factorio: Space Age that transports your character to any previously visited planet via death and respawn.

You bring no inventory through death/respawn, not even your armor and weapons.
There is an option to remove the countdown after dying to respawn instantly when using this mod's buttons.

Possible uses for this mod:
* You rush to Fulgora and realize you're ill prepared. Warp back to Nauvis to build a better ship and try again without reloading any saves.
* Your Gleba factory collapses for mysterious spoilage-related reasons and you want to pop over to manually debug.
* You spell "HELP" with concrete on Aquilo as your ship is pummelled to bits by large asteroids.
* You're playing an Archipelago randomizer, and the unlocks for Gleba, Vulcanus, and Fulgora machines trickle in in random order.
